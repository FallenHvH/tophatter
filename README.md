# TopHatter README
This is for my bot TopHatter, runs on NodeJS

# Requirements
- NodeJS<br>
- A brain<br>

# Setup
1. Rename `settings.example.json` to `settings.json`<br>
2. Insert bot token into the token string, devtoken is if you want a dev branch (toggled by `"devMode": true`)<br>
3. Open CMD and run `npm install` and wait for it to finish<br>
4. Run `node bot.js` in CMD to run the bot. It should say something like `{botname} is now ðŸŸ¢ONLINE`<br>
5. Profit

#### NOTE: SQL database is a work in progress, will make a command to create all the tables and everything.
